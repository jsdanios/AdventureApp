# AdventureApp

an attempt to develop an app using Spring Boot and Angular

vision for this project is to generate a random location within a certain radius of the user's location and award points to the user for going to that location
due to difficulties with the stack, the only working version of the app is located at github.com/danielraybarber/BoldlyGo
